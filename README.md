Fare Calculator App - App for calculating taxi fare between two addresses using Google Places and Distance Matrix APIs. 

Addresses are input using Google Places AutoComplete API. An Http request is sent to Google Servers that returns predictions for places in JSON format. App parses the JSON results and displays the predictions in ListView as AutoComplete suggestions. 

Distance and Time Duration between the two addresses is determined using Google distance matrix API. JSON result generated by Google servers is parsed by the app.

Fare is then calculated using the following formula
                  Fare = (distance_constant * distance) + (time_constant * timeDuration)
          where distance_constant and time_constant are constants.
